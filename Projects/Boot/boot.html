<H1>Cross Disciplinary Project BOOT: roBOts for real wOrld interacTion.</H1>
<H4> Last update: october 20th 2025</H4>

The CDP BOOT will end on january first 2026. We are thinking about an extension of this CDP.

I am leading the Cross Disciplinary Project BOOT (35 parterns, 10 research labs, 850 keuros) funded by IDEX Grenoble. The BOOT project aims to develop interdisciplinarity and scientific innovation in the field of robotics interacting 
with the real world in a strategy that departs from the current vision of robotics and its limitations. Moreover, this project aims to position Grenoble as one of the major players in robotics interacting with the real world, visible 
at the national and international levels. The CDP BOOT is one of the 21 major projects structuring research on the Grenoble site.
